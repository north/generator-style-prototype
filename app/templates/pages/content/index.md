# Content Strategy
#### Where it all begins

Content Strategy is a process by which, through a content inventory, content audit and examination of business needs, a holistic understanding of a business's content is achieved in order develop a content model and information architecture to best serve said business and its users. It is one of the most essential parts to design as it lays the groundwork for each feature that gets developed, be it for a web property, a native app property, a content feed, or any other mode of consumption.

## Vision Statement

The content strategy process should start with a vision for the design and development process. Each project needs a purpose and by defining a vision at the beginning of the process it becomes easier to identify what will provide the most value and ultimately produce a better end result. A good vision statement will answer the following questions:

* Who will use, buy, or consume the product?
* Who is our target customer?
* Who will administer and maintain the product?
* What needs will the product address?
* What attributes are critical to success?
* How does the product compare with existing products?
* What are the unique selling points?

By answering these questions at the offset of our project, we are able to use it as a guide throughout the whole design and development process. A vision statement provides a single grounding point for all decisions we need to make.

## Content Inventory

A content inventory takes an objective, broad strokes look at content currently available on a site. Generally built as a spreadsheet, it includes both intrinsic (title, owner, last updated) and analytical (page views, page rank, notes) data. They aren't just about pages, they are about the different pieces, or chunks, that go into making those pages. Your content is not just long blobs of text, it's also images, videos, charts, and any other form of information your user may want from you. We're interested not only in the types of content, but in their attributes as well, the metadata that make up a piece of content. 

## Content Audit

A content audit provides you with a first look at how your content is written as a way to begin the process of sussing out if what you currently offer is worth keeping, editing, or throwing away. Ask yourself the following questions:

* Is the content too long, too short, or just right? Can longer content be cut into shorter chunks and still make sense?
* Is the copy wordy? Does it ramble? Can you clean it up without loosing its meaning?
* Does each page or chunk get to the point quickly?
* Is the content even broken up into chunks?
* Is the content relevant and important?

After evaluating your content, start editing and cutting! Not everything needs to make the final site! You are now in a position to do a *gap analysis* of your content. Evaluate each piece of content and decide if you should keep it as is, revise and edit it, delete it because it's irrelevant, not useful, or outdated, or create new content where new business goals don't meet existing content.


## Content Model

A content inventory and content audit will allow you to start modeling your content. A content model is an overview of the different types of content available on your site and what individual attributes make up types of content. This can include different types of media, taxonomy terms, published content types, and content grouping mechanisms. A good content model includes both what is visible about a piece of content, and what is not, keeping in mind that some pieces of content may be exclusively used to group other types of content.

Each content type should include the following information:

* **Title** of content type.
* **Description** of content type.
* **Benefit Statement** written in the form `As [persona], I want [desire] so that [rationale]`. Each content type can have more than one benefit statement, but should include at least one. These statements should be measurable in one form or another.
* **Value** of content type, generalized. This can be as simple as an Agile number system, or as complex as a formula based on site analytics of page views, ad revenue, and development cost. This will allow you to prioritize development tasks based around your most valuable content. Consider including whether or not the benefit statements are in line with the goal of project as an aspect of value.
* **Attributes** that make up the content type. These are the individual chunks of information that make up a piece of content. Think of them as the metadata of the content. Each should include the limits present, such as character count or date format. When developing attributes, it is important to keep in mind that content no longer exclusively lives on websites and that blobs of content (blocks of HTML formatted text) are not ideal for cross-platform content reusability.
* **Relationships** that the content type has to other types of content.

## Information Architecture

Information architecture is all about what pieces of what content get used when, where, and why. Having a strong content model will provide for more options when developing your information architecture. Information architectures tend to be implementation-specific, but the content that it draws from should not be. You may find that when developing an information architecture that your content model won't quite match what you need. If that's the case, please do go back and revise your content model. When building out your information architecture and revising your content model, the following are good rules of thumb to follow:

* **Truncation is not a content strateâ€¦**. Simple, but often ignored. Content that is truncated is usually not written in such a way that the truncation will get your point across. It tends to not be written for reuse and tends to not include the trigger words that people pick up on easily. This is especially true for headlines. Don't ever truncate headlines.
* **Build systems of content**. Often times you'll need content of different sizes and different styles. Instead of relying upon truncation (see above) or a single one-size-fits-all approach to your content, allow for different versions of the same attribute in your content model. For instance, you could include small, medium, and large formats of an image or short and long human readable or SEO friendly headlines. Don't, however, build for specific contexts like iPhone, Android, Tablet, or Desktop.
* **Content should be easy to navigate**. Don't paginate long pieces of content unnecessarily. Make it easy to jump to sections of a large piece of content. Don't assume that a user that has location services enabled exclusively wants location-based information; always give them enough context to make their own navigation decisions. Provide plenty of, to use a term coined by Jared Spool, "trigger words" - words that inspire users to act because they make it obvious what will happen when users click on them. Think about if headlines can be used as links, or if you should provide alternative copy for links.
* **Content should be available**. Don't restrict content based on device; if a format can't be available due to, for instance, business needs on one platform, provide alternative formats. Store tabular data in such a way that it can be presented in multiple ways (i.e., not as an HTML table). Make your content available available and in a way that makes sense.
